Project Summary: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Objective:
The project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and income levels using K-Means clustering. This segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies to specific customer groups, enhancing customer engagement and targeting.

Dataset:
Source: Mall Customer Segmentation Data
File: Mall_Customers.csv
Features:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): Spending score assigned by the mall
Steps and Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Selected relevant numeric features for clustering: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).
Standardized these features using StandardScaler to ensure equal contribution to distance calculations in K-Means clustering.
Elbow Method for Optimal Clusters:

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters.
Observed the "elbow" point on the graph to decide the appropriate number of clusters.
K-Means Clustering:

Applied K-Means clustering with the optimal number of clusters (e.g., 5) to segment customers.
Assigned cluster labels to each customer based on their spending behavior and income.
Visualization:

Plotted customer segments using a scatter plot with matplotlib and seaborn, coloring the points by cluster labels to visually represent different customer groups.
Cluster Interpretation:

Added cluster labels to the original dataset.
Calculated and analyzed the mean values of numeric features (e.g., Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100)) for each cluster to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.
Results:
Clusters Identified:
Multiple customer segments were identified, each characterized by distinct spending scores and income levels.
Visual Insights:
Scatter plots provided a clear visual representation of different customer groups.
Cluster Analysis:
Each cluster's mean values for income and spending scores were analyzed to determine the profile of each customer segment (e.g., high-income, high-spending customers).
Business Implications:
Targeted Marketing:

Businesses can use the insights from customer segmentation to design targeted marketing campaigns tailored to the needs and behaviors of each customer group.
Product Development:

Understanding different customer segments helps in developing products and services that appeal to specific segments, improving customer satisfaction and sales.
Strategic Decisions:

Helps in making strategic decisions about resource allocation and customer engagement strategies based on the identified segments.
Tools and Technologies:
Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Techniques: Data Standardization, K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method, Data Visualization
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to segment customers effectively, providing actionable insights for marketing and business strategy. The use of K-Means clustering and visualization tools highlights the potential of data-driven decision-making in understanding and targeting customer segments.
